# InsightProblem
This is my solution to the Insight Data Engineering H1B problem. A detailed discription of the problem can be found here: https://github.com/InsightDataScience/h1b_statistics/blob/master/README.md
In sumary, we are given the task of analyzing rather long comma-seperated lists of H1-B visa reacords. We are then tasked with constructing a formatted top-10 list of states for certified applications, and another top-10 list of occupations for certified applications.
